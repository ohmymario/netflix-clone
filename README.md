# Netflix Clone

A Netflix clone created using React. The backend is using Firebase to keep the films, shows and users in the cloud. Be sure to sign up to see the whole project!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, Compound Components, Hooks, Firebase, Styled-Components, Fuse.js

This is my first time trying out compound components. This isn't really a technology but rather a pattern on how to create reusable components. I'm still not entirely sure if I'm sold though I do see that many popular React Libraries adopt it. There is a lot of setup before you can get up and running on any component and reading the components after doesn't always seem intuitive. This could just be me not being used to the layout. Using the components is completely different as it now feels like your own mini library.

Styled components again is a joy to use and keeps all CSS contained within the component. Firebase data was put into React Context to have the data easily accessible wherever I needed it, which was just the browse page to get sorted and then displayed.

## Optimizations

If during the time I was making this there was an API that easily kept update of Netflix's most popular shows then it would have been nice to have the selection live update. Perhaps on a schedule so I don't end up running up a bill. Another optimization idea to give the site more life is to have each selected show display the show trailer rather than a stock video. Most plans I had are addons rather than bug fixes.
